  ** Dynamic Memory 2 **

 ** Note: The goal of this assignment is to MODIFY the existing code. **  
Implement a dynamically allocated version of the mathematical concept of a 'set'. First,  examine the provided library and driver (in main) for a statically allocated Set class. You may also want to refresh your mathematical memory of the set concept before proceeding.

Now that you are familiar with how the Set class works, let's make it work better. Currently the user is limited to a certain maximum number of elements in their Set. Change it so the number of elements can be set dynamically during the program's execution.

Extend the driver to test all the ADT's operations.

** Things to Consider **
* If your set is implemented in dynamic memory:
  *  How do you access the members?
  *  How and when do you re-size the memory?
